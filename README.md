# 🎬 Sentiment Classification from Movie Reviews - Logistic Regression from Scratch

A machine learning project to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a custom-built **Logistic Regression** model — implemented entirely from scratch using `NumPy`.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Implement logistic regression without using scikit-learn's built-in models.
- Preprocess and vectorize raw movie review text data.
- Train and evaluate a binary classifier from scratch.
- Understand gradient descent, sigmoid activation, and cross-entropy loss.

## 🧠 Model

**Algorithm**: Logistic Regression  
**Implementation**: From scratch using only `NumPy`  
**Vectorization**: TF-IDF / CountVectorizer (scikit-learn)  
**Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Reads `reviews.csv` with text and binary sentiment labels.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, lowercase, remove punctuation.
3. **Vectorization**: TF-IDF or Count-based vector representation.
4. **Training**: Logistic Regression trained using gradient descent.
5. **Evaluation**: Metrics computed on held-out test set.
